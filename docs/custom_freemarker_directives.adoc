== Custom FreeMarker Directives

This project is a collection of FreeMarker user-defined directives
developed by kazurayam.

It was tested with FreeMarker v2.3.31.

=== readAllLines

The `readAllLines` directive reads a text file specified by the path parameter,
iterate over all lines in it, generate the templated body.
It will provide a loopVariable that contains the line.

Synopsis
----
<@readAllLines path="path to the file" ; line>
  <p>${line}</p>
</@readAllLines>
----

==== Motivation

Let me consider a case where I am going to generate a HTML file
using FreeMarker;
I have a simple text file with some number of lines,
and I want to insert HTML fragment as follows:

----
        <tr><td> ... line #1 ... </td></tr>
        <tr><td> ... line #2 ... </td></tr>
        <tr><td> ... line #3 ... </td></tr>
        ...
----

You may be or may not be aware, FreeMarker does not provide a built-in
directive with which I can read a text content from external file, and
transform the lines into HTML fragments.
The following diagram shows the basic how FreeMarker works.

Now I wanted to do something like this:

My custom `readAllLines` directive just enables me to do it.

==== Example

===== Caller Java

.ReadAllLinesDirectivesTest.java
[source,java]
----
include::../src/test/java/com/kazurayam/materialstore/freemarker/ReadAllLinesDirectiveTest.java[]
----

===== TestBase.java

The test classes here extends `TestBase.java` which prepares
the configuration of FreeMarker.
Please note that some sharedVariables are declared here,
which includes the name of directives (e.g, `readAllLines`).

.TestBase

===== Template

.readAllLinesDemo.ftlh

===== Input

===== Output

=== compressToSingleLine

The `compressToSingleLine` directive strips the following text fragments out of the body text.

1. Leading whitespaces of each lines (`^\s+`)
2. Traling whitespaces of each lines (`\s*$`)
3. Line breaks (`\r|\n`)

The whitespaces between the 1st printable character and the last printable character will be preseved
(will not be trimmed).

Empty lines will be ignored.

Consequently the body text will become a single line.

The `compressToSingleLine` directive takes no arguments.

Synopsis
----
<@compressToSingleLine>
    <#-- any body text -->
<@compressToSIngleLine>
----

==== Motivation

FreeMarker provides a few options of white-space handling.
See https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui_misc_whitespace.html[the document] for detail.

I was not satisfied with the standard options because I had a very particular requirement for white-space handling.
Let me show you an example.

My template produced this output:
----
      <span class="code">
            <span class="nochange">    {&quot;cat&quot;:  &quot;Nikolai, Marcus and Ume&quot;,
</span>
            <span class="nochange">     &quot;greeting&quot;:  &quot;Hello, world!&quot;}
</span>
      </span>
----

This output was problematic for me because:

1. I want to trim the indentation spaces before `<span>` in all lines.
2. I do not want to compress white-spaces inside `<span>` and `</span>`. I mean the 4 white-spaces in side `<span class="nochange">    {&quot;cat` should be retained.
3. The output has 6 lines. But I want all `<span>` tags concatinated without line breaks.
A sequence of `<span>` tags should form 1 single line.
In other words, I want to remove `\n` and `\r`.

The result I want looks as follows:

----
<span class="code"><span class="nochange">    {&quot;cat&quot;:  &quot;Nikolai, Marcus and Ume&quot;,</span><span class="nochange">     &quot;greeting&quot;:  &quot;Hello, world!&quot;}</span></span>
----

The built-in https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui_misc_whitespace.html#autoid_30[<#compress>] directory
does sightly different from what I want. So I developed a custom directory `@compressToSingleLine` for me.
